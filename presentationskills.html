A presentation is the process of presenting a topic to an audience. It is typically a demonstration, introduction, lecture, 
or speech meant to inform, persuade, or build good will. A presentation requires you to get a message across to the 
listeners and will often contain a 'persuasive' element. 
<br>
Strong presentation skills and the ability to engage and connect can truly set you apart from the crowd. Here are some 
free tips and resources to help you begin your journey.
A good presentation contains at least four elements:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Content — It contains information that people need. Presentations must account for how much information the 
audience can absorb in one sitting.</li>
<li> Structure — It has a logical beginning, middle, and end. The speaker must be careful not to lose the audience 
from the main point of the presentation.</li>
<li> Packaging — It must be well prepared. With a presentation, the audience is at the mercy of a presenter.</li>
<li>Human Element — A good presentation will be remembered much more than a good report because it has a 
person attached to it. You must analyze the audience's needs and address them</li></ul>.<br>

Good preparation lays the groundwork for making an effective presentation.<br>
The Key Elements of a Presentation<br>
<ms>Presentation:<br></ms>
* When and where will you deliver your presentation?<br>
* What equipment and technology will be available to you, and what will you be expected to use?<br>
* What is the audience expecting to learn from you and your presentation?<br>
<br><br>
<ms>Message:</ms>
The message is delivered not just by the spoken word (verbal communication) but can be augmented by techniques 
such as voice projection, body language, gestures, eye contact (non-verbal communication), and visual aids.
The message will also be affected by the audience’s expectations.
<br> <br>
<ms>Reaction:</ms>
The audience’s reaction and therefore the success of the presentation will largely depend upon whether you, as 
presenter, effectively communicated your message, and whether it met their expectations.
As a presenter, you don’t control the audience’s expectations. 
<br>
<br>
<ms>Impediments:</ms> 
Many factors can influence the effectiveness of how your message is communicated to the audience.
For example background noise or other distractions, an overly warm or cool room, or the time of day and state of 
audience alertness can all influence your audience’s level of concentration.
As presenter, you have to be prepared to cope with any such problems and try to keep your audience focussed on 
your message
<br>
<br>
    <h2>PREPARING A PRESENTATION</h2><br>
    <ls>THE OBJECTIVE</ls><br>
    You have been asked to speak to a group of people. First, ask yourself 'why?' What is the purpose of the presentation, 
    what is the objective, what outcome(s) do you and the audience expect?
    <br>It is useful to write down the reason you have been asked to present so you can use this as a constant reminder while 
    you prepare the presentation.
    <br>
    <ls>THE SUBJECT</ls><br>
    The subject of what you are going to talk about comes from the objective but they are not necessarily one and the 
    same thing.
    For example:
    <ul>
    <li> The subject may be given to you by an inviting organisation.</li>
    <li> You may be knowledgeable in particular field.</li>
    <li> The subject may be entirely your choice within certain limitations.</li><br></ul>
    <ls>THE AUDIENCE</ls><br>
    Before preparing material for a presentation, it is worth considering your prospective audience.
    Tailoring your talk to the audience is important and the following points should be considered:
    <ul>
        <li> The size of the group or audience expected.</li>
   <li> The age range - a talk aimed at retired people will be quite different from one aimed at teenagers.</li>
    <li> Gender - will the audience be predominantly male or female?</li>
   <li> Is it a captive audience or will they be there out interest?</li>
    <li> Will you be speaking in their work or leisure time?</li>
    <li> Do they know something about your subject already or will it be totally new to them? Is the subject part of their  work?</li>
    <li> Are you there to inform, teach, stimulate, or provoke?</li>
    <li>Can you use humour and if so what would be considered appropriate?</li></ul><br>
    <ls>THE PLACE</ls>
    <ul> 
    <li> It is important to have as much advance information as possible about the place where you are going to speak.</li>
    <li> Ideally, try to arrange to see the venue before the event, as it can be of great benefit to be familiar with the 
    surroundings.</li>
    <li> The availability of equipment, e.g., microphone, overhead projector, flip chart, computer equipment.</li>
    <li> The availability of power points and if an extension lead is required for any equipment you intend to use.</li>
    <li> If the room has curtains or blinds. This is relevant if you intend to use visual aids, and so that you can ensure 
    the correct ambiance for your presentation</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ls>SELECT YOUR MAIN POINTS</ls><br>
    The talk presentation should be divided into three sections:
    <ul>
    <li> Introduction (beginning)</li>
    <li> Main Content (middle)</li>
    <li> Conclusion (end)</li></ul><br>
    </ul>
    A useful structure would be the following:
    <li> Tell the audience in the introduction what your subject is and how you have organised the presentation </li>
    <li> Then tell them the details of the key elements and/or messages (by expanding and qualifying the key points in 
    more detail and providing supporting evidence).
    <li> Then tell the audience what you have just told them (by summarising the key points, concluding with the main 
    subject again).</li></ul><br>
    Work on the main content first.<br>
    From your notes decide on the most important things that need to be said. If you have too much material, be selective.
    <br><h4>As a guide</h4>
    <ul>
    <li> 3 key points are sufficient for a 10-15 minute presentation.
    <li> 6 key points are sufficient for a 30 minute presentation.
    <li>8 key points are sufficient for a 45 minute presentation.</ul>
    Arrange the key points in logical order and expand them with supporting material - discussion, argument, analysis 
    and appeal. If you are hoping to persuade people then it is advisable to address potential objections within the 
    presentation so that you present a reasoned, well-balanced view.
    <br>
    <br><ls>DECIDING WHETHER TO ILLUSTRATE</ls><br>
    <br>
    Most talks benefit from personal anecdotes, real-life situations or hypothetical examples to bring them to life.
    If the presentation is short and informal it is probably not necessary to use any visual aids. Use visual illustrations if 
    anything requires expanding, clarifying or simplifying. Illustrations of any type should be relevant and fully explained. 
    Bear in mind that a talk will last longer if visual aids are used.
    PowerPoint or other presentation software is often used to support a presentation, although care needs to be taken to 
    ensure that this technology aids the presentation and does not detract from the main essence of your talk. Do not use 
    visual aids or PowerPoint just for the sake of it or to show off your technological prowess, there is nothing more 
    distracting than whizzy and pointless PowerPoint animations in a presentation.
    <br><br><ls>INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUSION</ls><br><br>
    The introduction should give a preview of what you are going to say and should gain the attention of the listeners with 
    a statement of purpose. Make it clear whether you wish to accept questions as they arise during the presentation, 
    thereby breaking your flow and risk being side-tracked, or will invite questions at 
    Most presentations are divided into 3 main parts (+ questions)
    <br>
    <br>
    <h5>1 INTRODUCTION<br>
        2 BODY<br>
        3 CONCLUSION<br>
        4 QUESTIONS <br></h5>
        As a general rule in communication, repetition is valuable. In presentations, there is a golden rule about repetition:
        <br>1. Say what you are going to say...<br>
        2. say it...<br>
        3. then say what you have just said.<br>
        In other words, use the three parts of your presentation to reinforce your message. In the introduction, you tell your 
        audience what your message is going to be. In the body, you tell your audience your real message. In the conclusion, 
        you summarize what your message was.
        We will now consider each of these parts in more detail.
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        The introduction is a very important - perhaps the most important - part of your presentation. This is the first 
        impression that your audience have of you. You should concentrate on getting your introduction right. You should use 
        the introduction to:
        <h4>
        1. welcome your audience<br>
        2. introduce your subject<br>
        3. outline the structure of your presentation<br>
        4. give instructions about questions</h4><br>
        The following table shows examples of language for each of these functions. You may need to modify the language as 
        appropriate
        <table  border = 1px>
            <tr> 
            <th>Function</th>

                <li> Good morning, gentlemen</li>
                <li>Good afternoon, ladies and gentleman</li>

            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>
                    <ul><li> To start with I'll describe the progress made this year. Then I'll mention 
                        some of the problems we've encountered and how we overcame them. 
                        After that I'll consider the possibilities for further growth next year. 
                        Finally, I'll summarize my presentation (before concluding with some 
                        recommendations).</li></ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4. Giving instructions about 
                    questions </td>
                <td>
                    <ul><li>Do feel free to interrupt me if you have any questions.
                    </li>
                        <li> I'll try to answer all of your questions after the presentation.
                        </li>
                        <li>I plan to keep some time for questions after the presentation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
         
        <h4>Body</h4>
        The body is the 'real' presentation. If the introduction was well prepared and delivered, you will now be 'in control'. 
        You will be relaxed and confident.
        The body should be well structured, divided up logically, with plenty of carefully spaced visuals.
        Remember these key points while delivering the body of your presentation:
        <ul>
            <li> do not hurry</li>
            <li> be enthusiastic</li>
            <li>give time on visuals</li>
            <li> maintain eye contact</li>
            <li> modulate your voice</li>
            <li> look friendly</li>
            <li>keep to your structure</li>
            <li> use your notes</li>
            <li> signpost throughout</li>
            <li>remain polite when dealing with difficult questions</li>
         </ul>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        Use the conclusion to:
        <h4>
        
        1. Sum up<br>
        2. (Give recommendations if appropriate)<br>

        <br><br><h4>Questions</h4>
Questions are a good opportunity for you to interact with your audience. It may be helpful for you to try to predict what 
questions will be asked so that you can prepare your response in advance. You may wish to accept questions at any time 
during your presentation, or to keep a time for questions after your presentation. Normally, it's your decision, and you 
should make it clear during the introduction. Be polite with all questioners, even if they ask difficult questions. They are 
showing interest in what you have to say and they deserve attention. Sometimes you can reformulate a question. Or 
answer the question with another question. Or even ask for comment from the rest of the audience.
<h4>MAINTAINING AND PREPARING VISUAL AIDS / USING VISUAL AIDS DURING PRESENTATIONS
</h4>
Visual aids are essential to all successful presentations. The use of visual aids, coupled with good public speaking 
skills, work hand-in-hand to create effective presentations.
<h4>DESIGNING THE PRESENTATION:</h4>
The Three step approach 
<ul><li> Establish your objectives</li>
<li> Plan and organize your material and</li>
<li> Use appropriate visual aids</li></ul><br><br>
By establishing your objectives first, you can prepare material that supports each objective. The use of visual aids will 
move you further along toward your objectives by illustrating and emphasizing your ideas more effectively. <br>
<h4>Establishing the Objectives
</h4>
The key to designing your presentation is determining these objectives. Establishing the objectives for your 
presentation requires an analysis of your own goals, as well as your audience's needs and expectations. Select 
appropriate points of emphasis in your presentation and develop a useful level of detail
<h4>
    Planning and Organizing Your Material</h4>
    When you have determined the characteristics of your audience, tailor your approach accordingly.
Prepare an outline of goals, major issues to be discussed, and information to be presented to support main themes. 
Limit content to your major point and no more than five key supporting points.
When organizing your material, consider an “old chestnut” of public speaking – “Tell them what you're going to tell 
them; tell them; and tell them what you told them.”<br><br>
This recommendation:<br><br>
Recognizes the importance of reinforcement <br><br>
Completes the communication for the listener<br><br>
Informs people who arrive late of what they have missed<br><br>
<h4>Using Visual Aids</h4>
Visual aids help you reach your objectives by providing emphasis to whatever is being said. 
Clear pictures multiply the audience's level of understanding of the material presented, clarify points, and create 
excitement.
Visual aids involve your audience and require a change from one activity to another: from hearing to seeing. 
Visual aids add impact and interest to a presentation. 
They enable you to appeal to more than one sense at the same time, thereby increasing the audience's understanding 
and retention level. 
<h4>Retention of Information
</h4>
People tend to eye-minded, and the impacts visual aids bring to a presentation are, indeed, significant. The studies, 
below, reveal interesting statistics that support these findings:
In many studies, experimental psychologists and educators have found that retention of information three days after a 
meeting or other event is six times greater when information is presented by visual and oral means than when the 
information is presented by the spoken word alone.
The studies suggest that three days after an event, people retain 10% of what they heard from an oral presentation, 
35% from a visual presentation, and 65% from a visual and oral presentation.
The use of visual aids, then, is essential to all presentations. Without them, the impact of your presentation may leave 
the audience shortly after the audience leaves you. By preparing a presentation with visual aids that reinforce your 
main ideas, you will reach your audience far more effectively, and, perhaps, continue to “touch” them long after the 
presentation ends
<br>
<br>
<ls>ADDING THE VISUAL DIMENSION
</ls><Br><Br>
Visual aids and audio-visuals include a wide variety of communication products, including flip charts, overhead 
transparencies, slides, audio-slide shows, and video tapes. Demonstrating a process or simply passing around a 
sample of some equipment or model are also effective way to clarify messages visually. If visual aids are poorly 
selected or inadequately done, they will distract from what you are saying. The tips listed below will help you in the 
selection and preparation of visual aids.
<h4>Tips on Preparing Visual Aids
</h4>
Start with at least a rough outline of the goal and major points of the presentation before selecting the visual aid(s). 
For example, a particular scene or slides may trigger ideas for the presentation, providing the power of images. Do not 
proceed too far without first determining what you want to accomplish, what your audience wants to gain, and what 
the physical setting requires.<br><br>
Each element of an audio-visual product - a single slide or a page of a flip chart presentation, for example, - must be 
simple and contain only one message. Placing more than one message on a single image confuses the audience and 
diminishes the potential impact of visual media. Keep visual aids BRIEF.<br><br>
Determine the difference between what you will say and what the visual aid will show. Do not read straight from your 
visuals.<br><br>
Ask the audience to read or listen, not both; visual aids should not provide reading material while you talk. Rather, use 
them to illustrate or highlight your points.<br><br>
Give participants paper copies of various graphic aids used in your presentation. They will be able to write on the 
paper copies and have them for future reference.<br><br>
Assess your cost constraints. An overhead transparency presentation can always be used in a formal environment if 
35 mm slides are too expensive.<br><br>
Account for production time in your planning and selection process. Slides must be developed, videotape edited - you 
do not want to back yourself against a wall because the visuals are not ready. You can often get production work done 
in 24-48 hours, but it is much more expensive than work that is done on an extended schedule.
<br><br>Use local photographs and examples when discussing general problems and issues. While a general problem concerning 
welding safety, for example, may elude someone, illustrating with a system in use at the site can bring the issue home.
<br><br>Use charts and graphs to support the presentation of numerical information.
<br><br>Develop sketches and drawings to convey various designs and plans.<br><br>
When preparing graphics, make sure they are not too crowded in detail. Do no over-use color. See that line detail, 
letters, and symbols are bold enough to be seen from the back of the room.
<br><br>Do not use visual aids for persuasive statements, qualifying remarks, emotional appeals, or any type of rhetorical 
statement.<br><br>
If you have handouts, don't let them become a distraction during the presentation. They should provide reinforcement 
following your address. Consider giving them out after the presentation, unless the audience will use them during the 
presentation or will need to review them in advance of the presentation.<br><br>
<br>Practice presenting the full program using graphic materials so you are familiar with their use and order. If you use 
audio-visual materials, practice working with them and the equipment to get the timing down right.<br><br>
Seek feedback on the clarity of your visuals and do so early enough to allow yourself time to make needed 
adjustments.
<h4>
    What to Use, How to Choose
</h4>
The question of what to use and how to choose is an excellent one. The next several pages will help you answer this 
question by identifying the advantages and limitations of each type of visual, as well as the development techniques 
required in preparing each. By looking at these pros and cons, you can more easily decide what will work best for your 
presentation.
<ls>OVERHEAD TRANSPARENCIES
</ls>
<h4>Overhead Transparency 
</h4>
Projector Overhead transparencies are useful for audience settings of 20 to 50 people and can be produced quickly, 
easily, and inexpensively.<br><br>
Any camera-ready artwork, whether word charts, illustrations, or diagrams can be made into transparencies using 
standard office paper copiers.<br><br>
Most manufacturers of paper copiers offer clear and colored acetate sheets that run through copying machines like 
paper, but transfer a black image into acetate for use as overhead transparencies<br><br>
<h5>Limitations:
</h5>
<br>The projected image size is sometimes too small to be seen from the back of a large room.
<br>Often, the image does not sit square on the screen, as the head of the projector is tilted to increase the size of the image.
<br>It is difficult to write on the transparency while it is on the projector.
<br>Sometimes the projector head gets in the audience's way.
<br>Some speakers feel captive to the machine, because they must change each transparency by hand.
<br>When removing a transparency from the machine during the presentation, slide the next immediately underneath it to 
achieve a smooth transition. 
<br>Ideally, set the projector on a table lower than the surrounding tables or platforms to make it less imposing.
<br>Transparencies with too much information are confusing. Keep transparencies simple.
<br>Consider making use of a laser printer that can produce good quality transparencies in a variety of bold type styles.
<h4>
    Audio-Slide Show

</h4>
Audio-slide shows are self-contained programs having pre-recorded sound tracks that are coordinated with slides by 
use of electronic synchronizers. <br>
They can impart considerable information because color and a wide array of audio-techniques and visual images can 
be used.<br>
If multiple projectors are used with dissolve units that allow images to "fold" into one another, even a sense of 
movement can be created.<br>
They usually can be produces in-house, equipment is accessible, and they offer a presenter the flexibility of changing 
slides to meet the needs of specific audiences.<br>
<h5>Limitations</h5>
Time must be allotted for developing script, sound-track, title and credit slides, visuals, and for production.
Each presentation requires securing and assembling proper equipment synchronizer, tape recorder, projector(s), screen(s).
<br>
<br>
<h4>When Developing a Program:</h4>
Photograph or borrow slides of scenes that emphasize your points. 
<br>Also, gather charts, drawings, books, or other resource materials pertinent to the subject which may be photographed 
or reproduced graphically as slides.<br>
Keep images to one message per frame.<br>
Secure permission to use commercial or otherwise copyrighted music or material.
Keep credit slides to a minimum and use simple design for clarity.<br>
<h4>TESTING THE DESIGN OF YOUR PRESENTATION
</h4>
When you have prepared the visuals you want to use in your presentation, you must practice using them. <br>
Do a practice run in full, preferably with someone you know well and with someone you do not know well. <br>
Seek feedback. This will enable any needed changes to be incorporated easily.<br>
This feedback should include an evaluation of the presentation's length, logic, clarity, and interest level; the speaker's 
rate of delivery, voice level, and conversational pattern; and the usefulness of the visual aids.<br>
Check with the meeting organizer to make sure the equipment you need will be there.<br>
If at all possible, arrive at the location of your presentation an hour early to check your equipment and room 
arrangements.<br>
Rehearsal is a fundamental step in developing and refining effective presentations. <br>
<h4>
    DEALING WITH QUESTIONS
   
</h4>
The main rule of question sessions is to treat your audience with the respect you would like to have shown to you, and 
answer their questions directly and honestly.<br>
At the start of your presentation, you should make it clear whether and when you would prefer to deal with questions 
- as you go along or at the end of the presentation.<br>
If they have asked a question, it is because they want to know the answer.<br>
If a question is provocative, answer it directly. Never be rude to the questioner or show you are upset. Do not 
compromise yourself but maintain your point of view and never lose your temper.<br>
This tactic can be difficult to maintain but the key is being assertive.<br>
Many presentations today are followed up with a question and answer period. To some people this can <Br>
A 5 step approach to handling questions along with some additional tips to make your next question and answer 
session go smoother<br>
<h4>Listen to the entire question</h4>
Listen to the entire question BEFORE you begin to answer any questions. <br>
Not waiting to hear the entire questions can result in you providing a response which had nothing to do with the 
question. Make sure you understand the question<br>
<Br>
    1.<n> Pause</n> and allow yourself time to value the question and listener. REPEAT the question. It is important that 
everyone “hear” the question 
Repeating the question, will allow you some additional time to evaluate the question and formulate a response.
<br><br>2.<n> Credit The Person</n> for asking the question. You may say something like, “That was a great question” or, “Glad 
you asked that question” or even, “I get asked that question by many people”. 
One word of caution. If you credit one person with asking a question, be sure to credit EVERYONE for asking a 
question.Never say, Wow! What a question or Great Question, it’s a sign of embarrassment.
<Br><br>3. <n>Respond to the Question</n> honestly and the best you can. 
Be honest, and tell them you do not know but DO promise to research the answer for them and DO get back to 
them.
<br><br>4.<n> Bridge </n>to the next question by asking them a question. “Does that answer your question?”, “Is that the kind of 
information you were looking for?”.
<Br>
This is critical. Once they respond to you, “YES” you now have permission to go on to the next person. This also 
gives them one more opportunity to say, “No” and allow them to clarify their question more by asking it again.
