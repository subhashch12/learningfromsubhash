<t>EARLY LIFE</t>
<ul>
<li> Without money or connections, the only way Ma could get ahead was through education. After high school, he 
applied to go to college. After a great deal of studying, he finally passed on the third try, going on to attend 
Hangzhou Teacher's Institute<br><Br>
<li>Ma was a natural with his students and loved his job though he made only $12 a month at a local university.</li>
<Br><Br>
    <li> Ma had no experience with computers or coding, but he was captivated by the internet when he used it for the 
        first time during a trip to the US in 1995
    </li><br><Br>
 <li>The nickname, ‘Jack’ was given to him by a tourist he befriended.
    </li>       <br><br></li></ul>
    <t>MOMENT OF TRUTH</t><br><Br>
    He started a translation business and made the trip to help a Chinese firm recover a payment. Ma's first online 
    search was "beer," but he was surprised to find that no Chinese beers turned up in the results. It was then that 
    he decided to create an internet company for China 
    <t>INTRODUCTORY STEP</t>
    <ul>
        <li> Ma tried his luck by starting a venture, which later turned out to be a disaster.

        <li>
            Four years later he gathered 17 of his friends in his apartment and convinced them to invest in him and his 
            vision for an online marketplace he called "Alibaba." The site allowed exporters to post product listings that 
            customers could buy directly

            Soon, the service started to attract members from all over the world. By October 1999, the company had raised

            <li>
                When he applied to work in the police force, he was the only one that was rejected out of five applicants. He

Jack Ma is a classic rags-to-riches story, but even more impressive than his fabulous wealth is his uncanny level of 
persistence. He is proof that no series of failures (despite how cripplingly depressing) can keep someone from 
achieving their dreams.<br>

These are the most valued etiquettes in any business and are to be cherished.
<br>While social etiquettes are typical, cultural etiquettes are divergent in nature, yet they are separated only by a 
whisk Etiquette in Today's Society
Today's etiquette serves several important functions:<BR>
● Etiquette provides personal security. Knowing how to behave appropriately in a given situation makes you 
more comfortable.<BR>
● It protects the feelings of others. Proper etiquette requires that you make others comfortable and protect 
their feelings. You do not point out their errors or draw attention to their mistakes.<BR>
● It makes communication clearer. Etiquette enhances communication by breaking down barriers, not erecting 
them.<BR>
● It will enhance your status at work. In any working situation, you are perceived as more capable, more 
professional, and more intelligent if you are familiar with the proper code of conduct for the workplace.<BR>
● It makes good first impressions. The first five to seven seconds after you meet someone are crucial. Your first 
impression lingers in the other person's mind long after you are gone. If you use proper etiquette, that first 
impression will be a positive one.er<br><Br>

   <T> Why cultural etiquettes are branded divergent?</T><BR>
(Because, you can’t hug a woman just like that in a working place in India. You might land in serious trouble), “Be a 
Roman when you are in Rome”. As far as social etiquettes are considered they are to be followed if you are a 
determined employee.
What would you expect from an employee of your organisation?
Being late? Lazy? Irresponsible? You want him/her to follow the social etiquettes.
Business is a funny animal. On the one hand, the bottom line is considered the most important factor. However, if you get 
down to the nitty gritty, most people look at business etiquette and manners as essential to even get to the bottom line. 
There is a social element to most offices, so observe protocol and remember that your behaviour will affect your future.
<BR><T>Business relationships</T> – Knowing how to form and maintain business relationships can provide job security and a 
healthy bottom line. It's a good idea to limit personal conversations at the office on a need-to-know basis. Be a good 
team player, don't make annoying sounds that might distract others, and offer to assist coworkers if they need help.
<T>Proper attire</T> Know how to dress in any situation. If your office has "casual Fridays," don't dress like you're going to 
the beach. It's still a work environment and should be treated with respect. (Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs are 
exceptional cases)<BR>
<T>Getting ahead</T> – Learn what is expected in order to get ahead in your business. Show up on time, do a good job, and 
maintain a positive attitude.<BR>
<T>Office cubicles</T> – Cubicle-dwelling can be trying during the best of times. Knowing how to work closely with others is 
essential for anyone in an office. Be polite and respectful to those who work around you. Sorry you can’t move away 
from the box.<BR>
<T>Shaking hands</T> – A decent handshake can give someone a good first impression, and we all know that you only have 
one shot at that
<BR>
    <T>Business gifts </T> It’s always fun to give someone a gift to celebrate a special occasion, a promotion, or a job well done. 
    Make sure your gift is appropriate to the setting and occasion. You would never want to embarrass someone with a 
    personal or inappropriate gift. <BR>
    <T>Acknowledge others </T> When someone comes up with a brilliant idea or does something others need to know about, 
    be the first to congratulate him or her. Do this in meetings or in front of the boss to show that you are a team player. 
    Personal space- Do not exploit a person’s private area, it may create a bad impression irrespective of the gender. The 
    table is the divider.<BR>
    <T>Conversation</T> Learn how to hold a decent conversation, with back-and-forth dialogue. Never monopolize a 
    discussion, or you may find yourself stuck in a corner trying to figure out why others are walking a wide berth around 
    you.<BR>
    <T>Gossip</T> Never gossip. Not only is it bad form, if word ever got back to the person you were talking about, you can 
    pretty much be assured you’ll be the subject of the next gossip session.<BR>
    <T>People’s names</T>Everyone has one, and most people appreciate your effort to learn their names if you spend more 
    than a minute or two talking with them. This applies to social and business contacts.<BR>
    <T>Cell phones</T> In a nutshell, use your cell phone sparingly in public. No one else wants to listen in on a private 
    conversation or wait while you text someone the latest Internet joke<BR>
    <T> Politeness </T> Remember to always say please and thank you when you interact with others, in person or over written 
    correspondence. Being polite makes you pleasant to work with and shows respect.<bR>
    <T>Tone</T>Never raise your voice to others in the work environment, or use foul language toward them. Keep your tone 
    as neutral as possible, and avoid “talking down” to others.<bR>
    <T>Rude questions </T> answer a rude question, don't say anything. Just smile and change the subject.<BR>
    <T>Men’s manners </T> This one is simple: All you have to do is be a gentleman. Rudeness is never manly.<BR>
    <T>Women’s manners </T> You can be a lady and still show strength    <BR>

<H4>BUSINESS CULTURE, PRACTICES & ETIQUETTE TIPS</H4><BR>

India is a rapidly growing marketplace that is tipped to be one of the largest economies in the world in the near future. 
Ensure your business etiquette, and knowledge of their culture, is accurate to maximise your potential and avoid 
unnecessary awkwardness.<BR>

<T>What to wear</T><BR>
Conservative dress is most suitable for both men and women
Dark suits for men - in hotter regions it can be acceptable to dress less formally
For women, conservative dresses or business suits, but avoid showing too much leg if wearing skirts or dresses
Casual wear is not recommended for a first meeting<BR>
<T>Titles</T><BR>
Address people by their professional title (Dr, professor etc.) or, Mr or Mrs, followed by their surname
Wait until invited to address someone by their first name, or preferred name
If in doubt, use the suffix Mr or Mrs, especially when addressing elders. Sir or Madam is also appropriate
Remember, status is dependent upon education, caste, age and profession address people accordingly if possible
<BR><T>Business cards</T><BR>
Business cards may be given after the initial handshakes and greetings
Give and receive cards with your right hand
Higher educational degrees are a symbol of status – remember to put this on your business card
Give cards face up so that they can be easily read
As business is often conducted in English it is unnecessary to translate one side of your card
<br><T>Meetings</T><bR>
Plan and organise meetings well in advance of your trip, if travelling long distances, as they may often be postponed. 
Check again before travelling
Be punctual – this shows respect and integrity
Business meetings often begin with small talk
This may continue for an extended time as Indians prefer doing business when they are familiar with someone
Ask your hosts personal questions; family, marriage, education and sport are good starting points. Avoid politics, 
religion and the caste system
If unsure on any matter, defer to the senior person in the room as they will generally control the final decision
Follow up meetings with an overview of discussions and decisions<BR>
<T>Negotiating</T><br>
Saying ‘no’ is too direct and confrontational for many Indians.
Instead they will often say ‘maybe’ or ‘I’m not sure’. If this occurs change tack or rephrase question if possible
Avoid any hard sell or appearing too demanding – Indians prefer harmony and respect
Having said that, they can also bargain and will often barter for what they want
Do not be tempted to show impatience or anger. Remain calm throughout the negotiating process
Your interactions with your own countrymen will be monitored – try not to disagree publicly
Final decisions will be made by the most senior person present and may take time – be patient
<br>
<T>Management</T><br>
Remain aware of superiors and treat them accordingly
Indian society is built upon close familial relationships which can cross over into the business world. Be aware of ties 
that run through the business you are dealing with
A paternalistic approach is often taken by managers in India due to hierarchical structures
Managers will make decisions but they are also responsible for those below them within the business’ structure

<h4>BUSINESS CULTURE, PRACTICES & ETIQUETTE TIPS USA
</h4>
<t>What to wear 
</t><br>

Dress code depends on where in the USA you are doing business. The weather and local culture will determine what is 
appropriate or not.
In general, people in the East dress more formally, while people in the West are known for being a bit more casual.
It is best to always dress conservatively until it is clear what the accepted dress code is.
Men should wear shirts with suits and shoes. Ties are generally worn but not in all States. Colours should be 
traditional such as black, blue, grey, etc.
Women should wear modestly with not too much make-up or jewellery. Low-cut blouses, short skirts and tight 
clothing are not appropriate.
‘Casual Friday’ is common in many companies. High technology companies often wear casual clothes every day.
<br>
<t>Titles</t><br>
Most Americans move to a first name basis pretty quickly.
Always start by addressing people using Mr/Mrs/Miss + surname until you are invited to call them otherwise.
Some, such as Doctors, will use their professional titles.
<br>
<t>Business cards</t><br>
Americans have no etiquette when it comes to giving and receiving business cards.
They are swapped with no fanfare.
It is quite common for the recipient to put your card in their wallet, which may then go in the back pocket of their 
trousers. This is not an insult. May be yes.
<br><t>Meetings</t><br>
Arrive on time for meetings since time and punctuality are so important to Americans
In the Northeast and Midwest, people are extremely punctual and view it as a sign of disrespect for someone to be late 
for a meeting or appointment.
In the Southern and Western states, people may be a little more relaxed, but to be safe, always arrive on time, 
although you may have to wait a little before your meeting begins.
Meetings may appear relaxed, but they are taken quite seriously. If there is an agenda, it will be followed.
At the conclusion of the meeting, there will be a summary of what was decided, a list of who will implement which 
facets and a list of the next steps to be taken and by whom.
Use statistics to back up your claims, since Americans are impressed by hard data and evidence.
The emphasis is on getting a contract signed rather than building a relationship. The relationship may develop once 
the first contract has been signed
<br><t>Negotiating</t><br>
Final decisions are usually made from the top down although group consensus is valued.
Hard selling tactics are used from time to time.
The deal at hand is always more important than then personal relationship.
Americans sometimes start negotiations with excessive demands or a low price. They are usually taking a starting 
position that gives them room to bargain.
Negotiations may seem rushed – always remember that "time is money" to Americans.
<br>
<t>Management</t>
In the U.S.A, there is a sense that all people in the organization have an important role to play and all are valued for 
their input.
American managers are viewed as facilitators--people who help employees do their best work--and not simply 
decision makers.
Missing a deadline is a sign of poor management and inefficiency

<h4>THE 10 BASICS OF BUSINESS ETIQUETTE</h4><br>
In the business world, good manners is essential for getting ahead. Proper etiquette can help people land jobs, get 
promotions and establish excellent relationships with others. The most successful businessmen and women know 
how to turn on the charm and exhibit their best business etiquette to get the job done professionally and effectively.
<br><t>Listening Skill</t><br>
Communication is the lifeblood of business. For people to get along, work in unison and establish professional 
relationships with one another, they must communicate with the appropriate etiquette. Listening skills are a main 
part of communication etiquette. When others are speaking do not interrupt them. Employ active listening techniques, 
such as making good eye contact and showing the speaker that you are paying attention to them.
<br><t>Meetings</t><br>
The Society for Technical Communication says it is proper business etiquette to show up on time, or, preferably, a few 
minutes early to meetings. Come prepared with pen and paper.<br><Br>
<t>Attire</t><br>
The way you dress impacts whether you have good business etiquette. The business world is professional, and the 
people who work in it must dress to reflect that level of professionalism. As such, make sure your clothes are clean 
and pressed, and that you wear suits, blouses, skirts, blazers, ties or other clothing that makes a good impression.<br>
<t>Politeness</t><br>
Remember to always say please and thank you when you interact with others, in person or over written 
correspondence. Being polite makes you pleasant to work with and shows respect.<br>
<t>Best Behavior</t><br>
To be on your best behavior, always give others your utmost attention when they are speaking or conducting a 
presentation. Put your cell phone away during this time and do not engage in side conversations with coworkers.<br>
<t>Handshake</t><br>
Shaking hands with your business counterparts establishes rapport and is in good form. For international 
interactions, research how that culture greets one another professionally in business, as not all countries see shaking 
hands as a form of respect.<br>
<br><t>Table Manners</t><br>
There will be times when you have to attend a business luncheon. According to the University of Delaware, some 
tableside manners to practice are not speaking with your mouth full, using your napkin and not setting bags or 
briefcases on the table.<br>
<t>Diplomacy</t><br>
Ravenwerks, an organization for global ethics, etiquette and effectiveness, says to always be diplomatic when engaged 
in a business conversation, even if you disagree with what others are saying. Apologize if you step on other peoples’ 
toes, but do not be afraid to hold true to your convictions.<br>
<t>Tone</t><br>
Never raise your voice to others in the work environment, or use foul language toward them. Keep your tone as 
neutral as possible, and avoid “talking down” to others.<br>
<t>Following Up</t><br>
Following up correspondence is seen as a proper gesture. After working with a client, customer or coworker it is in 
good form to send a thank-you email or note, recognizing their business or efforts
<h3>WRITING COMPANY BLOGS
</h3>
<t>Why do I need a blog? What’s a blog?</t><br>A business blog is one of the most cost-effective and easiest ways to promote your business. Done right, it can drive 
traffic to your website, increase your sales, establish you as an authority in your industry and also help you to reach 
new markets. Unfortunately, many small businesses are yet to wake up to the benefits of this tool. Valid reasons range 
from lack of time for writing the blog posts to a lack of ideas for quality posts.<br>
Why did Fogg succeed and what lesson other brands can learn from this?<br>
What can other brands, especially new brands learn from this? Will this success last? We hope so, but we will not get into 
that today.<br>
Let me repeat it with lessons a new brand should take.<br>
1. Launch a differentiated product - if you can. It is never easy. Fogg launched a no gas deo (after market research 
revealed that people felt the deos did not last long).<br>
2. Communicate something new and something that furthers your cause. When every one was talking about babe 
magnet, Fogg talked about value for money; wastage when you buy deos with gas. Point one, if a brand shows sex appeal 
the consumer watching the ad will not notice much. He might even attribute the ad to Axe. He has seen it a hundred times. 
Fogg stood out.
Point two, Fogg had a differentiated product and when you have that you need to communicate the difference in a 
manner that catches attention. Fogg went functional and talked about 800 sprays and value for money. It clicked. Finally, 
the product seems to have delivered on the promise.
As a new brand, if your product is differentiated go ahead and talk about it. If not, at least do not follow the leader. 
Differentiate your packaging, your communication and your overall strategy. Be different somehow to get noticed.<br>
3. Fogg did not limit the scope to men and targeted the entire market. As a new brand, try to go for the biggest pie. 
Why leave out a good 30% of women consumers? Fogg must have asked itself. Interestingly, Emami did not ask this when 
they launched HE while ITC did launch Engage for both men and women.<Br>
4. Fogg priced the product above Axe. A bold move. As a new product, if you have a different product and you charge 
more, you create a positive impression. If you are a me-too product, it will be difficult to justify the premium.<br>
5. Fogg built a good distribution network. There are two battles in marketing. One fought in the minds of the 
consumer and the second in the market. No brand can grow without good distribution. It has to be your focus always. <br>
Fogg was lucky 75% of its market was in top 20 towns. Even then it would have been tough for them to build a good 
distribution so fast.<br>
Activity: Design a blog to sell water bottles, school bags, 
Divide the class into teams to design an eye-catchy blog with an interesting title. Give them tips on what to enter and 
what not to. Just say creativity will be rewarded. Remind them about flipkart, amazon and whatever that attracts the 
customer to buy their products. Why people are attracted towards 999/- only and not 1000<br>
<br><Br>Let’s admit it.<br>
Blogging is hard work.<Br>
And we all wonder sometimes whether it’s worth all the effort.<br>
Can you really create a business blog that generates an endless stream of leads and customers? Can you write a 
business blog so good that readers desperately want to work with you and buy from you?
<br>
Getting your blog readers to fall head-over-heels in love with your company, may sound like a daunting, perhaps 
impossible, task. But it really doesn’t need to be. You just need to observe a few simple rules.
<br>Follow these 6 rules and you may find yourself winning more business than you can deal with
<br><img src="cococola.jpeg" class="centre"><br>

<t>Rule 1: Stop spreading sales messages</t><br>
Are you writing your blog for your company or for your readers?
<br>
Your objective of blogging may be to generate leads, to increase web traffic, or to raise your profile as an authority. 
But if you use your blog just to spread your sales messages, you may struggle to find readers. You might not win the 
clients you’re looking for. And your blog may remain a lonely voice whispering quietly while no one pays attention.
<br>
Most people aren’t interested in your sales messages. Most people aren’t even interested in your business. They want 
to know what’s in it for them.
<br>
<img src="cadbary.jpeg" class="centre">
<br>
To gain business with your blog you should stop thinking like a salesman and start acting like your reader’s mentor. A 
salesman wonders how to get his next sale. A mentor cares about his students. He wants to help them get ahead and 
live a more fulfilled life.<br>
By providing solid advice on a regular basis, you build authority and trust; and that’s how you win new customers. To 
start wooing customers with your blog, answer these two critical questions:
<br>1. Who are you writing for? Try to be specific. When you can visualize an ideal reader or buyer persona, your 
writing becomes more vivid, more personal, and more engaging.
<br>2. How can you help your readers? Consider what your ideal reader is dreaming of, and how you can help him 
achieve his goals.<br>
When you write your next blog post, forget about your company for a moment and consider how you can help your 
readers. When you stop pitching on your blog, you start selling more.<br>
<t>Rule 2: Get rid of a corporate tone</t><br>
Nobody chats with a robot. Nobody bonds with a call center menu. Nobody gossips with a corporation.
To engage your readers, make your writing more conversational. Have you noticed how I’ve sprinkled questions 
throughout this blog post? And how these questions address you as a reader directly because I’m using the word you?
That’s how I try to engage you. A blog post shouldn’t be a monologue but a conversation; and questions are the most 
important tool of good conversationalists.
You might think that writing conversational content requires you to record yourself talking and then typing out your 
text. But have you ever seen a full transcript of an interview?
It’s full of wishy-washy words, grammar mistakes, and sentences that haven’t been finished. Writing conversational 
content doesn’t mean you write as you talk. Instead: you edit your text so that it doesn’t sound like writing
<br><img src="flip1.jpeg" class="centre"><br>
This is how you get rid of a dull corporate tone:
<ul>
<li> Scrap gobbledygook like cutting-edge, world-class, and customer service excellence. You don’t really use those 
words when you talk, do you?</li>
<li> Slaughter the passive voice. Rather than write Your email will be answered (passive), write: We’ll answer your 
email within 24 hours (active)</li>
<li> Kill long paragraphs and dense blocks of text. To enter a conversation you need to give your reader time to 
breathe – that’s what white space is for.</li>
<li> Use contractions like they’ll, he’s, and we’re, because they’re more informal.</li>
</ul>Conversational content makes your reader feel you’re talking WITH him—NOT talking AT him. You’re engaging him in 
your conversation, and encourage him to leave a comment, send you an email, or buy from you
<br>
<t>Rule 3: Compose deliciously seductive headlines<br>
</t>
Do your blog posts receive the attention they deserve?<br>
Are your headlines so delicious, so tempting that people feel compelled to click through and read your posts?<br>
<img src="pringles.jpeg"   class="centre" width="300px" height="250px"><br>
A lip-smacking good headline fulfils two crucial requirements:
<br>&#10145 Attract attention by using sensory or emotional words. Numbers also work well in headlines because they stop 
wandering eyes in social media streams. Eg: 999 only only only. (you paused here for a moment, I got you)
<br>&#10145Make a reader curious enough to click through by promising a specific benefit when reading the post.
<br>The specific benefit I promised you in this post’s headline, is that you learn how to write blog posts that help you win 
customers. To make the headline more compelling I added a number (7 tips) and the emotional words to enchant and
to woo.
<br>Seductive headlines help you gain more readers and more customers. Spend time practicing your headlines and study 
the headlines of popular blogs
<br><t>Rule 4: Create enticing opening paragraphs
</t>
We live in a distracted world.<br> 
<br>Each piece of content is battling for reader attention. Emails pop up. Twitter streams and Facebook updates distract 
your readers. You need to work hard to grab attention and keep it.
<br>To captivate your reader and entice him to read your post, you need to write a seductive introduction paragraph. 
Follow this simple 3-step formula
<Br>&#10145  Empathize with your reader and tell him he’s not the only one struggling with a specific problem.
<Br>&#10145  Promise your reader your advice will make his life better.
<br>&#10145  Reassure your reader that your tips are easy—everyone loves shortcuts, simple tricks, and straightforward 
formulas.<br>
In the opening paragraph of this post I empathized with your doubts about blogging, and then promised you that your 
blog can generate an endless stream of leads and customers just by following these six simple rules.<br></body>
<t>Rule 5: Write inspirational conclusions</t><br>
<br>A blog post isn’t an academic essay in which you sum up the findings of your research. Your final paragraph provides 
you with an opportunity to inspire your reader so she can take away your advice, remember it, and act on it.
<br>When you reward your reader with an incredibly useful tip each time she reads your blog posts, she’ll come back 
again and again for more tips. But serving up a useful tip isn’t enough. You have to inspire your reader to act.
<Br>How? Consider the issues that sabotage your reader’s good intentions. What blocks her from acting upon your advice? 
If your reader feels overwhelmed, remind her of the first step she should take. If she lacks confidence, give her a peptalk. If she feels it’s too much work to implement your advice, then remind her how much better she’ll feel after 
implementing your suggestions.
<br>A useful tip that’s not implemented is like a riveting book that’s never been opened. Your job as blogger is not just to 
share useful advice, but to encourage your reader to act. Don’t let your blog posts fizzle out.
<br><t>Rule 6: Create an email list</t>
<br>
A blog without an email list is like city without any transport links. People might fly in or turn up by accident, but 
they’ll find it difficult to find their way back after a first visit.
Email allows you to build a connection with readers and coax them back to your blog to read more. When you turn up 
once a week in a reader’s inbox, he can get to know you, like you, and trust you. That’s how you earn an opportunity to 
sell.
<br>
To boost your email list:
<Br>&#10145Tell readers the benefit of signing up. What will they learn? How will you help them save or make money? Or 
help them become happier or more productive?
<Br>&#10145 Consider a relevant bonus like an ebook, video, or free e-course.
<Br>&#10145 Place your sign-up form in strategic locations, like at the bottom of a blog posts, in your side bar, on your home
page, and on your about page.<br>
Consider it an honor when people allow you into their inbox. Build a relationship with them over time, and you’ll earn 
the opportunity to sell them.
